Camper is an educational service for coding students to review, share, and extend their learning.

Students select a web development topic they want to learn more about. From there, a series of subtopics is retrieved and content is dynamically populated into the site.

Coders read important review content while watching related videos and adding helpful comments. They can extend their learning by visiting the top questions asked from Stackoverflow and even refer to MDN resources and learn from MOOCs.
